## Description

Affiliates for WooCommerce is a plugin that allows site owners to create an affiliate marketing program for their online store. The plugin allows affiliates to promote the store and earn a commission on sales made through their unique affiliate links.

Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing where businesses pay affiliates for each customer they bring to their website. The affiliate promotes the business's products or services through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, or their website, and earns a commission for each sale made through their unique affiliate link.

With Affiliates for WooCommerce, site owners can easily set up an affiliate program and recruit affiliates to promote their products. The plugin provides a dashboard where affiliates can view their earnings, track clicks and sales, and access marketing materials such as banners and text links. Affiliates can also generate their unique affiliate links, which they can share with their audience to earn commissions on any sales made through those links.

Site owners have complete control over their affiliate program, including setting commission rates, defining cookie expiration periods, and setting minimum payout thresholds. They can also view reports on affiliate activity, including the number of clicks, impressions, and conversions.
